Implementing an environment in which you can play games with your opponent.

When you run a game program, the image where the start/quit button exists appears and when you press start, it switches to a screen where you can play games.

6. Background image

We changed the cold, dark background to simple and bright.

Furthermore, if you delete multiple lines at once, you get additional points.
