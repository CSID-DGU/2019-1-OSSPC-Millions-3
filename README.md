## What improved?

1. Background music and sound effect.

That function did not exist in existing programs.
The sound effects was recorded in the voices of the developers.

Also, The music changes according to the block height.

The ability to set the key that you want. (Functions that can be set up: Right, Left, Down, Drop, Rotation, Hold)

3. End-of-game 

Unlike the existing program that stopped only the screen when the game ended, the game was terminated by inserting a Game Over image and an effect tone.

4. counterpart play screen

Implementing an environment in which you can play games with your opponent.

5. Start screen

When you run a game program, the image where the start/quit button exists appears and when you press start, it switches to a screen where you can play games.

6. Background image

We changed the cold, dark background to simple and bright.

7. My score

Unlike previous programs that didn't show their own scores when playing, we produce window that shows the scores they accumulate whenever they reduce blocks. 
Furthermore, if you delete multiple lines at once, you get additional points.
